# Canada.ca Email Notification Services

Subscription service to send mass mailing via the notification service from CDS. 

[How to do the setup](setup.md)

[Tests](https://github.com/ServiceCanada/x-notify/tree/master/test)

## Load tests

Run bash script "load-run.sh" for load testing. More instructions in the file.

## Start the application

`node server.js`

or

`docker-compose up --build`


## Create topic

A topic could be compared to a mailing list.

Each topic is unilingual. They are created in pair.

For each topic you need:
* Unique Notify API key: "team and safe senders"
* Notify template ID that represent the confirmation email
* Confirmation subscription link
* Confirmation unsubscription link


## Topic naming convention

`{2-3 letter group name abbreviation}-{short topic name}{2 letter language}`

### database command sample

```
db.topics.insertOne( {
    _id: "test2",
    templateId: "<template id available in the template in Notify>",
    notifyKey: "<A valid Notify API key>",
    confirmURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html",
    unsubURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html",
    nTemplateMailingId: "<template ID for sending a corresponding mailing>"
})
```

Create a topic detail

```
db.topics_details.insertOne( {
    _id: "test2",
    accessCode: [ "123456" ],
	createdAt: ISODate( "2020-03-21T00:00:00.000-04:00" ),
	lastUpdated: ISODate( "2020-03-21T00:00:00.000-04:00" ),
	groupName: "Department Name",
	description: "Used for this service, related to request #",
	lang: "en",
	langAlt: [ "test" ],
	nServiceId: "test-serviceID-to-be-extracted-from-Notify-API-key"
})
```

### (Optional) Create a topic for an app handling POST volume

You need to add the last three URLs for redirection

```
db.topics.insertOne( {
    _id: "test2",
    templateId: "<template id available in the template in Notify>",
    notifyKey: "<A valid Notify API key>",
    confirmURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html",
    unsubURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html",
	thankURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html",
    inputErrURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html",
    failURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html"
})
```

Same, but to update an existing topic

```
db.topics.updateOne( {
		_id: "test"
	},
	{
		$set: {
			thankURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html",
			inputErrURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html",
			failURL: "https://canada.ca/en.html"
		}
	}
);
```

To remove it
```
db.topics.updateOne( {
		_id: "test"
	},
	{
		$unset: {
			thankURL: "",
			inputErrURL: "",
			failURL: ""
		}
	}
);
```
